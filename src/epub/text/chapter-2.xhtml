				<p>I saw no more of Stella for a lengthy while, since within two days of the events recorded it pleased my mother to seek out another summer resort.</p>
				<p>“For in September,” she said, “I really must have perfect quiet and unimpeachable butter, and falling leaves, and only a very few congenial people to be melancholy with⁠—and that sort of thing, you know. I find it freshens one up so against the winter.”</p>
				<p>It was a signal feature of my mother’s conversation that you never understood, precisely, what she was talking about.</p>
				<p>Thus in her train the silly, pretty woman drew otherwhither her hobbledehoy son, as indeed Claire Bulmer Townsend had aforetime drawn an armament of more mature and stolid members of my sex. I was always proud of my handsome mother, but without any aspirations, however theoretical, toward intimacy; and her periods of conscientious if vague affection, when she recollected its propriety, I endured with consolatory foreknowledge of an impendent, more agreeable era of neglect.</p>
				<p>I fancy that at bottom I was without suspecting it lonely. I was an only child; my father had died, as has been hinted, when I was in kilts.⁠ ⁠… No, I must have graduated from kilts into “knee-pants” when the Democracy of Lichfield celebrated Grover Cleveland’s first election as President, for I was seven years old then, and was allowed to stay up ever so late after supper to watch the torchlight parade. I recollect being rather pleasantly scared by the yells of all those marching people and by the glistening of their faces as the irregular flaring torches heaved by; and I recollect how delightfully the cold night air was flavored with kerosene. In any event, it was on this generally festive November night that my father again took too much to drink, and, coming home toward morning, lay down and went to sleep in the vestibule between our front-door and the storm-doors; and five days later died of pneumonia⁠ ⁠… In that era I was accounted an odd boy; given to reading and secretive ways, and, they record, to long silences throughout which my lips would move noiselessly. “Just talking to one of my friends,” they tell me I was used to explain; though it was not until my career at King’s College that I may be said to have pretended to intimacy with anybody.</p>

				<p>For in old Fairhaven I spent, of course, a period of ostensible study, as four generations of my fathers had done aforetime. But in that leisured, slatternly and ancient city I garnered a far larger harvest of (comparatively) innocuous cakes and ale than of authentic learning, and at my graduation carried little of moment from the place save many memories of Bettie Hamlyn.⁠ ⁠… Her father taught me Latin at King’s College, while Bettie taught me human intimacy⁠—almost. Looking back, I have not ever been intimate with anybody.⁠ ⁠…</p>
				<p>Not but that I had my friends. In particular I remember those four of us who always called ourselves⁠—in flat defiance, just as Dumas did, of mere arithmetic⁠—“The Three Musketeers.” I think that we loved one another very greatly during the four years we spent together in our youth. I like to believe we did, and to remember the boys who were once unreasonably happy, even now. It does not seem to count, somehow, that Aramis has taken to drink and every other inexpedient course, I hear, and that I would not recognize him today, were we two to encounter casually⁠—or Athos, either, I suppose, now that he has been so long in the Philippines.</p>
				<p>And as for D’Artagnan⁠—or Billy Woods, if you prefer the appellation which his sponsors gave him⁠—why we are still good friends and always will be, I suppose. But we are not particularly intimate; and very certainly we will never again read <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Chastelard</i> together and declaim the more impassioned parts of it⁠—and in fine, I cannot help seeing, nowadays, that, especially since his marriage, Billy has developed into a rather obvious and stupid person, and that he considers me to be a bit of a bad egg. And in a phrase, when we are together, just we two, we smoke a great deal and do not talk any more than is necessary.</p>
				<p>And once I would have quite sincerely enjoyed any death, however excruciating, which promoted the well-being of Billy Woods; and he viewed me not dissimilarly, I believe.⁠ ⁠… However, after all, this was a long, long while ago, and in a period almost antediluvian.</p>
				<p>And during this period they of Fairhaven assumed I was in love with Bettie Hamlyn; and for a very little while, at the beginning, had I assumed as much. More lately was my error flagrantly apparent when I fell in love with someone else, and sincerely in love, and found to my amazement that, upon the whole, I preferred Bettie’s companionship to that of the woman I adored. By and by, though, I learned to accept this odd, continuing phenomenon much as I had learned to accept the sunrise.</p>

				<p>Once Bettie demanded of me, “I often wonder what you really think of me? Honest injun, I mean.”</p>
				<p>I meditated, and presently began, with leisure:</p>
				<p>“Miss Hamlyn is a young woman of considerable personal attractions, and with one exception is unhandicapped by accomplishments. She plays the piano, it is true, but she does it divinely and she neither crochets nor embroiders presents for people, nor sketches, nor recites, nor sings, or in fine annoys the public in any way whatsoever. Her enemies deny that she is good-looking, but even her friends concede her curious picturesqueness and her knowledge of it. Her penetration, indeed, is not to be despised; she has even grasped the fact that all men are not necessarily fools in spite of the fashion in which they talk to women. It must be admitted, however, that her emotions are prone to take precedence of her reasoning powers: thus she is not easily misled from getting what she desires, save by those whom she loves, because in argument, while always illogical, she is invariably convincing⁠—”</p>
				<p>Miss Hamlyn sniffed. “This is, perhaps, the inevitable effect of twenty cigarettes a day,” was her cryptic comment. “Nevertheless, it does affect me with ennui.”</p>
				<p>“⁠—For, the mere facts of the case she plainly demonstrates, with the abettance of her dimples, to be an affair of unimportance; the real point is what she wishes done about it. Yet the proffering of any particular piece of advice does not necessarily signify that she either expects or wishes it to be followed, since had she been present at the Creation she would have cheerfully pointed out to the Deity His various mistakes, and have offered her cooperation toward bettering matters, and have thought a deal less of Him had He accepted it; but this is merely a habit⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Yes?” said Bettie, yawning; and she added: “Do you know, Robin, the saddest and most desolate thing in the world is to practise an étude of Schumann’s in nine flats, and the next is to realize that a man who has been in love with you has recovered for keeps?”</p>
				<p>“⁠—It must not be imagined, however, that Miss Hamlyn is untruthful, for when driven by impertinences into a corner she conceals her real opinion by voicing it quite honestly as if she were joking. Thereupon you credit her with the employment of irony and the possession of every imaginable and super-angelical characteristic⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Unless we come to a better understanding,” Miss Hamlyn crisply began, “we had better stop right here before we come to a worse⁠—”</p>
				<p>“⁠—Miss Hamlyn, in a word, is possessed of no insufferable virtues and of many endearing faults; and in common with the rest of humanity, she regards her disapproval of any proceeding as clear proof of its impropriety.” This was largely apropos of a fire-new debate concerning the deleterious effects of cigarette-smoking; and when I had made an end, and doggedly lighted another one of them, Bettie said nothing.⁠ ⁠… She minded chiefly that one of us should have thought of the other without bias. She said it was not fair. And I know now that she was right.</p>
				<p>But of Bettie Hamlyn, for reasons you may learn hereafter if you so elect, I honestly prefer to write not at all. Four years, in fine, we spent to every purpose together, and they were very happy years. To record them would be desecration.</p>

				<p>Meantime, during these years, I had fallen in and out of love assiduously. Since the Anabasis of lad’s love traverses a monotonous country, where one hill is largely like another, and one meadow a duplicate of the next to the last daffodil, I may with profit dwell upon the greensickness lightly. It suffices that in the course of these four years I challenged superstition by adoring thirteen girls, and, worse than that, wrote verses of them.</p>
				<p>I give you their names herewith⁠—though not their workaday names, lest the wives of divers people be offended (and in many cases, surprised), but the appellatives which figured in my rhymes. They were Heart’s Desire, Florimel, Dolores, Yolande, Adelais, Sylvia, Heart o’ My Heart, Chloris, Felise, Ettarre, Phyllis, Phyllida, and Dorothy. Here was a rosary of exquisite names, I even now concede; and the owner of each nom de plume I, for however brief a period, adored for this or that peculiar excellence; and by ordinary without presuming to mention the fact to any of these divinities save Heart o’ My Heart, who was, after all, only a Penate.</p>
				<p>Outside the elevated orbits of rhyme she was called Elizabeth Hamlyn; and it afterward became apparent to me that I, in reality, wrote all the verses of this period solely for the pleasure of reading them aloud to Bettie, for certainly I disclosed their existence to no one else⁠—except just one or two to Phyllida, who was “literary.”</p>
				<p>And the upshot of all this heartburning is most succinctly given in my own far from impeccable verse, as Bettie Hamlyn heard the summing-up one evening in May. It was the year I graduated from King’s College, and the exact relation of the date to the Annos Domini is trivial. But the battle of Manila had just been fought, and off Santiago Captain Sampson and Commander Schley were still hunting for Cervera’s “phantom fleet.” And in Fairhaven, as I remember it, although there was a highly-colored picture of Commodore Dewey in the barbershop window, nobody was bothering in the least about the war except when Colonel Snawley and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Jeal foregathered at Clarriker’s Emporium to denounce the colossal errors of “imperialism.”⁠ ⁠…</p>

				<p>For this was the year that I graduated, and Chloris⁠—I violate no confidence in stating that her actual name was Aurelia Minns, and that she had been, for a greater number of years than it would be courteous to remember, the undisputed belle of Fairhaven⁠—had that very afternoon married a promising young doctor; and I was draining the cup of my misery to the last delicious drop, and was of course inspired thereby to the perpetration of such melancholy bathos as only a carefree youth of twenty is capable of evolving.</p>

				<p>“Dear boy,” said Bettie, when I had made an end of reading, “and are you very miserable?”</p>
				<p>Her fingers were interlocked behind her small black head; and the sympathy with which she regarded me was tenderly flavored with amusement.</p>
				<p>This much I noticed as I glanced upward from my manuscript, and mustered a Spartan smile. “If misery loves company, then am I the least unhappy soul alive. For I don’t want anybody but just you, and I believe I never will.”</p>
				<p>“Oh⁠—? But I don’t count.” The girl continued, with composure: “Or rather, I have always counted your affairs, so that I know precisely what it all amounts to.”</p>
				<p>“Sum total?”</p>
				<p>“A lot of imitation emotions.” She added hastily: “Oh, quite a good imitation, dear; you are smooth enough to see to that. Why, I remember once⁠—when you read me that first sonnet, sitting all hunched up on the little stool, and pretending you didn’t know I knew who you meant me to know it was for, and ending with a really very effective, breathless sob⁠—and caught my hand and pressed it to your forehead for a moment⁠—Why, that time I was thoroughly rattled and almost believed⁠—even I⁠—that⁠—” She shrugged. “And if I had been younger⁠—!” she said, half regretfully, for at this time Bettie was very nearly twenty-two.</p>
				<p>“Yes.” The effective breathless sob responded to what had virtually been an encore. “I have not forgotten.”</p>
				<p>“Only for a moment, though.” Miss Hamlyn reflected, and then added, brightly: “Now, most girls would have liked it, for it sounded all wool. And they would have gone into it, as you wanted, and have been very, very happy for a while. Then, after a time⁠—after you had got a sonnet or two out of it, and had made a sufficiency of pretty speeches⁠—you would have gone for an admiring walk about yourself, and would have inspected your sensations and have applauded them, quite enthusiastically, and would have said, in effect: ‘Madam, I thank you for your attention. Pray regard the incident as closed.’ ”</p>
				<p>“You are doing me,” I observed, “an injustice. And however tiny they may be, I hate ’em.”</p>
				<p>“But, Robin, can’t you see,” she said, with an odd earnestness, “that to be fond of you is quite disgracefully easy, even though⁠—” Bettie Hamlyn said, presently: “Why, your one object in life appears to be to find a girl who will allow you to moon around her and make verses about her. Oh, very well! I met today just the sort of pretty idiot who will let you do it. She is visiting Kathleen Eppes for the Finals. She has a great deal of money, too, I hear.” And Bettie mentioned a name.</p>
				<p>“That’s rather queer,” said I. “I used to know that girl. She will be at the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">K.A.</abbr> dance tomorrow night, I suppose,”⁠—and I put up my manuscript with a large air of tolerance. “I dare say that I have been exaggerating matters a bit, after all. Any woman who treated me in the way that Miss Aurelia did is not, really, worthy of regret. And in any event, I got a ballade out of her and six⁠—no, seven⁠—other poems.”</p>
				<p>For the name which Bettie had mentioned was that of Stella Musgrave, and I was, somehow, curiously desirous to come again to Stella, and nervous about it, too, even then.⁠ ⁠…</p>
